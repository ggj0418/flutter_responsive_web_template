# flutter_responsive_web_template

A new Flutter project.

## Description

This project is for responsive ui with web and mobile screen.
If you stretch out screen size in web, non-application screen will be smaller as you want.
Since I had a hard time drawing this ui, I am sharing this repository to inform you that it is possible in this way.
Good luck.
